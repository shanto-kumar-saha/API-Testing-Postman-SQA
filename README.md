## üìù Description 
API testing is a type of software testing where application programming interfaces (APIs) are tested to determine if they meet expectations for functionality reliability performance and security. API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. This repository I did User's API's testing by using Postman tool.
